# r2sbml
R interface to the SBML library

This is a work in progress. The aim of this project is to provide an interface to read in SBML models in `R`. Eventually, I want to be able to read in an SBML file and convert it into a model which can be simulated in R/MATLAB/Julia. 
Currently the package only contains example `R` scripts from `libsbml` library.
